## Enhancing Agri-Sustainability: Multimodal Recommendations for Demand â€“ Supply Alignment

# Overview
This project aims to enhance agricultural sustainability by providing multimodal recommendations for crop selection based on soil characteristics, market demand, and supply alignment. By integrating predictive analytics, machine learning, and market analysis, the system assists farmers in making informed decisions for crop selection, thereby improving productivity and sustainability in the agricultural sector.

# Features
Multimodal Recommendations: Utilizes both textual and image data for crop forecasting and recommendation.
Market Analysis: Incorporates market dynamics to align crop selection with market demand-supply equilibrium.
Enhanced Decision-making: Provides farmers with a tool for informed decision-making in crop selection, enhancing productivity and sustainability.

# Technologies Used
Python: Backend development, machine learning models, and data processing.
Flask: Web framework for building the application.
SQLite: Database for storing crop prices, user data, and prediction results.
TensorFlow/Keras: Machine learning libraries for training and deploying models.
Chart.js: JavaScript library for visualizing market data.
Machine Learning: Random Forest and Neural Network models for crop prediction.
Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend interface.
